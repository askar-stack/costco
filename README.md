There were some nice design pieces in this email that I wanted to try
achieving using MJML. THe source is here: http://click.online.costco.com/dm?id=86516FADEFF0C9DF0A662CE060F1A09386BF5533976B1DCA

The actual email was much longer. I shortened it a bit to save time.

I initially tried to use mjml columns for the Shope Current section which was a struggle. I found out about tables
and I was good to go after that. Using borders to give the spaced out look.
